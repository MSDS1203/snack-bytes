Steps to Run the Application
1. Open the login.html file with Live Server or Five Server extension in VS code (or an equivalent for other IDEs)
2. Log in/create an account on the login page. If you create an account, you will automatically be logged in.
3. Click on a leaderboard for any game to see the current high scores (and see if your high score is up there)
4. Open up a game and try beating your high score!
5. If you like your score, you can hit the "submit score" button on the game to save your new high score.
6. You can navigate between the home page to check the leaderboards as well as the other games. 

Here is a test user account if you don't want to create your own account:

password: hithere!

You can also change the theme of the website by hovering over the cog in the top right corner of the application. The theme changes will be carried over as well to the other games (with the exception of Solitaire).
